Instructions:
This file contains two functions: biasedrolls and draw_histogram

biased_rolls(prob_list , s, n):
- Takes in the as inputs, the number of sides on the dice (m), the probability list containing the probability of getting each output (prob_list), and the number of rolls (n).
- m and n are intergers
- As output, it returns the p]output of n rolls of a die by comparing a random probability with the probability list

def draw_histogram(m, rolls, width):
- Takes in as input, the number of sides on the dice (m), the output list of n rolls (rolls), and the max height of the histogram bar (width).
- As output, it prints or a horizontal histogram showing the prbability distribution of the die's outputs
